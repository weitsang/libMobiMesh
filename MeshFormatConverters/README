This file contains instructions on how to compile and run the mesh
converter program.

Building the converters
-----------------------
All the OpenMesh dependencies have been included and modified
accordingly. Simply type "make" at the command prompt to compile.

To clean up the directory, type "make clean".

Converting from .pm to .vpm
---------------------------
Use the program "apmesh" for this. The command is:
./apmesh <pm file path> -o <vpm file path>

The pm file should end with .pm extension, and the desired output
vpm file path should end with the .vpm extension.

Converting from .vpm to .tvpm or .tvpm64
----------------------------------------
Use the program "cpmesh" for this. The command is:
./cpmesh <vpm file path> -o <tvpm file path>

The vpm file path should end with either .vpm or 64.vpm, and the
tvpm file path should end with either .tvpm or .tvpm64 respectively.
The .vpm and .tvpm extensions refer to a 32 bit vertex ID mesh format,
and the 64.vpm and .tvpm64 refer to a 64 bit vertex ID mesh format.
